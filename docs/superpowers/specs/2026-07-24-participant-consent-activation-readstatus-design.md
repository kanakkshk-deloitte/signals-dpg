# Participant consent — activation, multi-profile & read-status (extends #309)

**Issue:** [#309](https://github.com/Blue-Dots-Economy/signals-dpg/issues/309)
**Extends:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-participant-compliance-consent-design.md` (the base compliance-recording design, already implemented on branch `feat/participant-compliance-consent` / draft PR #354).
**Depends on:** PR #353 ("always-create profiles + per-user cap", #349) — see §Dependency.
**Date:** 2026-07-24
**Status:** Design — pending review.

## Why this extension

The base design (2026-07-22) added the `compliance` array, recorded consent into the ledger on the `/admin/participant` write path, and promoted profiles to `live`. Real usage surfaced more flows that must be handled:

- Aggregator **bulk / registration-link** creates a user + profile with *minimal* data and **no consent, no DOB** → `draft`. A later channel (voice) call must be able to **collect consent + fields + DOB and activate that profile**.
- A user can hold **multiple profiles** (post-#353); the bot must know **which profile has consent** and which is usable for apply/connect.
- The bot must be able to **read consent status** before driving the collection flow.

## Confirmed principles

- **All of `compliance` is optional** — the array itself and every key within it. Bulk / registration-link send no consent and no DOB → user + profile created as `draft`, nothing recorded. Callers sending only the deprecated `terms_accepted`/`privacy_accepted` booleans are unaffected (those are ignored).
- **`user_terms` + `user_privacy` are a both-or-none pair** — accept both platform consents together, or send neither. One without the other → **`400 USER_LEVEL_INCOMPLETE`**. (Schema-level; domain-agnostic.)
- **On guardian-gated domains, recording user consent requires `date_of_birth`.** When the pair is present (being recorded) **and** the call's domain is guardian-gated, `date_of_birth` must also be present → else **`400 DOB_REQUIRED`**. This stops a gated (seeker) profile being left consented-but-DOB-less (which would strand it in `draft`). On **non-gated** domains, DOB is **not** required with consent. *(Handler-level — the check needs `guardianConsentRequired(networkConfig, domain)`, which isn't available at Zod time.)*
- **`date_of_birth` is otherwise optional and independent** — user-level; may be sent with consent, on its own, or omitted. (Only the gated-domain rule above ever makes it mandatory.)
- **`compliance` is accept-only — ANY `false` is an error.** Every `compliance` entry that is sent MUST be `value: true`. **Any** entry with `value: false` — `user_terms`, `user_privacy`, **or** `profile_creation` — → **reject the whole request, performing no create / update / consent write** (**`400 CONSENT_DECLINED`**). To *not* consent to something, **omit its key** — never send `false`. (There is no "declined" state stored; consent is recorded or absent.)
- **`profile_creation` is optional and item-level.** Present with `true` → recorded for that `item_id` (then promote); **omitted** → skipped → the profile is still created/kept as `draft`. (Present with `false` → rejected, per accept-only above.) Declining by *omission* never blocks creating the draft (creating needs no consent).
- **Fail-closed, no bypass:** missing DOB on a guardian-gated (seeker) domain → `draft`; a **minor** DOB → the profile is still **created** but stays `draft`, to be completed via the **portal**. Never assume adult. *(Future: DOB is replaced by year-of-birth; a U18 still gets a draft profile and completes it via the portal — no change here beyond the payload swap.)*
- **Creating a profile requires no consent.** `item_state` (no `item_id`) always creates the profile; with no `profile_creation` it simply stays `draft`. Consent and DOB only gate **go-live**, never creation.
- **Consent scope differs by level:**
  - `terms`, `privacy` — **user-level**; accepted once (as a pair), inherited by all the user's profiles.
  - `profile_creation` — **item-level**; each profile needs its own row (keyed to `item_id`) — but only to go live, not to be created.
  - `date_of_birth` — **user-level**; required alongside user consent only on guardian-gated domains, optional otherwise.
- **Multi-profile routing (post-#353, refined here):** `item_state` *without* `item_id` → creates a **new** profile (bounded by `MAX_PROFILES_PER_USER`). **`item_id` targets that existing profile**, and `item_state` on that call is *optional*: if given it updates the fields, if omitted the fields are unchanged. Either way the call records any `compliance` (incl. item-level `profile_creation` for that `item_id`) and re-promotes. *(This refines #353's resolver — which today routes an `item_id` with no `item_state` to the account-only path — so a consent-only activation can target a specific draft without re-sending its fields.)*
- **User-level consent with no item → account-only:** a call carrying the `user_terms`+`user_privacy` pair (+ `date_of_birth`) and no `item_state`/`item_id` records terms/privacy, persists DOB, then promotes **all** the user's eligible consented drafts (DOB is user-level).

## Go-live gate checklist (unchanged, for reference)

A profile becomes `live` only when all hold: (1) required fields complete; (2) `terms`+`privacy` recorded (user-level); (3) `profile_creation` recorded (this item); (4) DOB present + adult on a gated domain; (5) currently `draft`. Promotion always runs through `promoteItemOnProfileConsent` → `guardianGateBlocksGoLive` (the single age-gate source of truth; never re-derived).

## Write side — `POST /admin/participant`

Already implemented on PR #354 (base design): optional `compliance`; deprecated-and-ignored `terms_accepted`/`privacy_accepted`; consent recording per verdict branch inside a transaction; `lifecycle_status` + `consent_recorded` on the response; promotion via the shared gate.

**New deltas in this extension:**

0. **Request validation.** Three checks, in this order, all returning `400` before/at the start of handling:
   - **Accept-only (schema-level, `superRefine`, checked first):** any `compliance` entry present with `value: false` (any key, incl. `profile_creation`) → **`400 CONSENT_DECLINED`** (no create/update/consent). Omit a key to skip it; never send `false`.
   - **User-consent pair (schema-level, `superRefine`):** `user_terms` and `user_privacy` are both-or-none — exactly one present → **`400 USER_LEVEL_INCOMPLETE`**.
   - **DOB-required-on-gated (handler-level, after network config resolves):** if the user-consent pair is being recorded **and** the call's domain is guardian-gated (`guardianConsentRequired(networkConfig, domain)`) **and** `date_of_birth` is absent → **`400 DOB_REQUIRED`**. Non-gated domains skip this — consent without DOB is fine there.
   - **Precedence:** `CONSENT_DECLINED` (any `false`) is evaluated before the pair and DOB rules.
   The first two are pure payload checks (Zod). The DOB rule can't be — it depends on network config — so it lives in the handler. `date_of_birth` itself stays independently optional (may be sent alone or omitted); only the gated rule makes it mandatory.

1. **Persist `date_of_birth` on the update path.** Today DOB is written only when a user is *created* (`buildOnboardingSet` in the create branches). The update/enrichment path never writes it. Change: when `date_of_birth` is provided for an existing user, update `user.date_of_birth` — **only when provided** (never overwrite with `null`) — and do it **before** promotion so the guardian gate sees the new value.

2. **Promote all eligible drafts on a DOB-bearing call.** Because DOB is user-level, setting it can unblock *several* of the user's profiles. When a call provides `date_of_birth`, after persisting it, re-run promotion for **all** the user's `draft` items that already have `profile_creation` consent (a helper, e.g. `promoteEligibleDraftsForUser(tx, userId)` — query the user's draft items in served networks, keep those with a `profile_creation` row, promote each via `promoteItemOnProfileConsent`). Bounded by the profile cap. Calls that don't carry DOB keep the existing per-item promotion only.

3. **Dedupe user-level consent.** When recording `terms`/`privacy`, skip the insert if a row already exists for `(userId, network, category)` at the **current** resolved version; write a new row only when it's genuinely new or the version changed. Prevents multi-profile users accumulating duplicate user-level rows. `profile_creation` stays per-item (its own `onConflictDoNothing` idempotency, unchanged).

4. **2nd (and Nth) profile:** a call with `item_state` and no `item_id` → `insert_item` creates a new profile (bounded by the cap). Consent is optional here too — with no `profile_creation` the new profile is created `draft`; include `profile_creation` (on this call, or later via the profile's `item_id`) to promote it. `terms`/`privacy` and DOB are inherited from the user, so a new profile needs only its own `profile_creation` + a complete `item_state` to go `live` (re-sending user-level keys is harmless — deduped per §3).

**Activation / enrichment call** (bulk-created draft → live):
```jsonc
POST /admin/participant
{
  "email": "asha@example.com",           // (or phone) existing user
  "name": "Asha P",
  "item_id": "‹draft profile id from the create response / GET›",   // REQUIRED to target it
  "item_state": { /* full enriched profile fields */ },             // completes the profile
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",          // persisted now → age gate
  "compliance": [
    { "key": "profile_creation", "value": true }   // + user_terms/user_privacy if not already on file
  ],
  "network": "blue_dot", "domain": "seeker", "item_type": "profile_1.0"
}
```
→ updates fields, persists DOB (before promote), records consent, promotes → `live`.

**Full create example — new user + profile with all consent + DOB (single-call go-live):**
```jsonc
POST /api/v1/admin/participant
x-api-key: <apikey>
x-acting-org-id: <org id>
content-type: application/json

{
  "email": "asha@example.com",
  "phone_number": "+919876543210",
  "name": "Asha P",
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",           // adult → passes the age gate
  "compliance": [
    { "key": "user_terms",       "value": true },   // user-level
    { "key": "user_privacy",     "value": true },   // user-level
    { "key": "profile_creation", "value": true }    // item-level (this profile)
  ],
  "channel": "voice",
  "item_state": { /* all required profile fields → complete */ },
  "network": "blue_dot",
  "domain": "seeker",
  "item_type": "profile_1.0"
  // no item_id → creates a new profile
}
```
→ creates the user (DOB stored) + a new profile; records `terms` + `privacy` (user-level) and `profile_creation` (item-level); adult + complete → promoted. Response:
```jsonc
{
  "user_id": "usr_…",
  "user_existed": false,
  "owned_elsewhere": false,
  "onboarded_at": "2026-07-24T…",
  "items": [
    {
      "item_id": "itm_…",
      "item_network": "blue_dot",
      "item_domain": "seeker",
      "item_type": "profile_1.0",
      "lifecycle_status": "live",
      "item_state": { … },
      "item_locations": [ … ],
      "created_at": "…",
      "updated_at": "…"
    }
  ],
  "consent_recorded": 3
}
```

### Activation payload variants

All of these target an existing user (identify by `email` or `phone_number`; `name` is required by the schema, so pass the existing name). Each promotes only if the profile ends up complete + the go-live gate passes. Remember: `user_terms` + `user_privacy` are a **both-or-none pair**, `profile_creation` is independent, and `date_of_birth` is required alongside the pair **only on guardian-gated domains** (see the invalid cases below).

**(a) Activate a draft by sending only its `profile_creation` consent — no field re-send** (user already has the terms/privacy + DOB bundle on file):
```jsonc
{
  "email": "asha@example.com",
  "name": "Asha P",
  "item_id": "‹draft profile id›",        // targets that profile; no item_state → fields unchanged
  "compliance": [ { "key": "profile_creation", "value": true } ]
}
// → records profile_creation for that item, re-promotes → live
```

**(b) Send the full user-level bundle (terms + privacy + DOB) — no item targeting** (account-only; promotes ALL the user's consented drafts):
```jsonc
{
  "email": "asha@example.com",
  "name": "Asha P",
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",          // persisted on the user (user-level)
  "compliance": [
    { "key": "user_terms",   "value": true },
    { "key": "user_privacy", "value": true }
  ]
  // no item_id, no item_state
}
// → records terms+privacy, persists DOB, promotes every draft profile that already has profile_creation
```

**(c) Everything-at-once on one draft — full user-level bundle + `profile_creation` via `item_id`** (nothing was recorded at create time):
```jsonc
{
  "email": "asha@example.com",
  "name": "Asha P",
  "item_id": "‹draft profile id›",
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
  "compliance": [
    { "key": "user_terms",       "value": true },
    { "key": "user_privacy",     "value": true },
    { "key": "profile_creation", "value": true }
  ]
  // item_state optional — include it to also fill/complete the profile fields
}
// → records terms+privacy+profile_creation, persists DOB, re-promotes → live (if complete)
```

**Invalid — rejected by validation:**
- **Broken consent pair** — exactly one of `user_terms` / `user_privacy` present → **`400 USER_LEVEL_INCOMPLETE`** (they're both-or-none). *(Schema-level.)*
- **Consent without DOB on a gated domain** — the pair is present on a guardian-gated (seeker) domain but `date_of_birth` is missing → **`400 DOB_REQUIRED`**. On a **non-gated** domain this is allowed (DOB not required). *(Handler-level.)*
- **Any declined consent** — `user_terms`, `user_privacy`, **or** `profile_creation` sent as `false` → **`400 CONSENT_DECLINED`**; nothing is created or updated. (Omit a key to skip it — never send `false`.) `CONSENT_DECLINED` wins over the other two.

Prerequisites: `profile_creation` is recorded only once `terms` + `privacy` exist (already on file, or sent in the same call). Variant (a) assumes terms/privacy are already on file; if not, send the pair in that call too (and `date_of_birth` as well when the domain is guardian-gated).

## Read side — `GET /admin/participant` (new)

Extend the read endpoint (`participant_read.ts` / `GetParticipantResponse`) to return consent status so the bot can drive the flow and pick a usable profile.

```jsonc
{
  "user_id": "usr_…",
  "user_consent": {
    "terms_accepted": true,        // plain boolean (any accepted row present)
    "privacy_accepted": true,      // plain boolean
    "has_date_of_birth": true      // presence only — NOT the DOB value (PII)
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "item_id": "itm_A",
      "item_type": "profile_1.0",
      "lifecycle_status": "live",
      "profile_consent_accepted": true,    // profile_creation recorded for THIS item
      "item_state": { … }
      /* … existing snapshot fields … */
    },
    {
      "item_id": "itm_B",
      "lifecycle_status": "draft",
      "profile_consent_accepted": false,
      "item_state": { … }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `user_consent.terms_accepted` / `privacy_accepted`: **plain booleans** (presence of any accepted row; version numbers are intentionally not surfaced).
- `user_consent.has_date_of_birth`: **presence boolean**, not the value.
- Per item: `profile_consent_accepted` (does this item have a `profile_creation` row) + `lifecycle_status` (already added by the base design).
- Computed via batched `consent_record` reads (user-level categories for the user; item-level `profile_creation` for the returned item ids) + the `user.date_of_birth` presence.
- **Auth/scoping unchanged:** same admin apikey + acting-org; aggregators still see only their own users; consent status follows the same scoping.

## Bot flow (case 4)

1. **GET** `/admin/participant` (email/phone) → read `user_consent` + per-profile `profile_consent_accepted` / `lifecycle_status`.
2. Determine what's outstanding for the target profile (consent? DOB? fields?). The bot computes completeness itself from `item_state` + the item schema — **no completeness hint is returned** by the API.
3. Collect the missing pieces from the user on the call.
4. **POST** the activation call above (`item_id` + `item_state` + `compliance` + `date_of_birth`) → `live`.

## Scenarios (consolidated)

| # | Scenario | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bulk / reg-link create, no `compliance`/DOB | `draft` |
| 2 | **Gated** (seeker) create: pair + DOB(adult) + `profile_creation` + complete | `live` |
| 3 | **Non-gated** (provider/orange/yellow) create: pair + `profile_creation` + complete, **no DOB** | `live` (DOB not required off gated domains) |
| 4 | Only one of `user_terms` / `user_privacy` sent | **`400 USER_LEVEL_INCOMPLETE`** |
| 5 | **Gated** domain: pair sent but **no `date_of_birth`** | **`400 DOB_REQUIRED`** |
| 6 | **Any** compliance key = `false` | **`400 CONSENT_DECLINED`** — nothing created/updated (wins over the other two) |
| 7 | Bulk draft → later activation (GET → POST `item_id` + pair + `profile_creation` [+ DOB if gated]) | `live` |
| 8 | 2nd profile (`item_state`, no `item_id`, + `profile_creation`; user-level inherited) | `live` if complete (+ adult on gated) |
| 9 | Minor / unknown DOB on gated domain | profile **created** but `draft` (fail-closed; complete via portal) |
| 10 | Multi-profile | each profile `live` iff its own `profile_creation` + user-level satisfied |
| 11 | Pair + DOB, **no item** (account-only) | terms/privacy+DOB recorded; **all** eligible consented drafts promoted (§Write.2) |

## Future note — DOB → year-of-birth

Age capture is expected to move from full date of birth to **year of birth only**. Once that change is in place, the participant API accepts **year of birth** instead of a full `date_of_birth`, and the minor/adult computation uses the year. Until then we keep `date_of_birth` (full date) exactly as today — no change here.

**Deferred — reject U18 at the participant API (add after the DOB→age migration).** The eventual intent is: if the user is **U18, the whole request is rejected with an error and NO operation is performed** — no user/profile create, no update, and **the consent itself is treated as invalid and not recorded**. A minor must onboard via the portal (guardian OTP flow), never a server-to-server channel.

**Current behaviour (NOT the target — will change with the migration):** today a minor *can* "accept" consent through this API — the `compliance` rows **are recorded** and the profile is simply held in `draft` by the fail-closed guardian gate (see scenario #9 / the `G2` GET example: `profile_consent_accepted: true` but `lifecycle_status: draft`). This is acceptable only because DOB is client-supplied and unverified today.

**When age replaces DOB:** add an early U18 check in `participant_handler` — if the computed age is under 18, return an error (e.g. `400 U18_NOT_ALLOWED`) **before** any create/update/consent write, so a minor's request performs nothing and records no consent. This supersedes the "minor → recorded-but-draft" behaviour above.

## Backward compatibility — verified against `aggregator-dpg`

Bulk upload and registration-link onboarding are **unaffected**. The `signalstack-writer` sends only `name` / `terms_accepted` / `privacy_accepted` (= `presume_consent`) / `channel` / `source_id` / `network` / `domain` / `item_type` (+ `item_state`) — **no `compliance`, no `date_of_birth`** (`http.ts:174`, `bulk-row-process.ts:410`, `public-registration-links.ts:555`). So none of the new validation (accept-only / pair / gated-DOB) can trigger, the deprecated booleans are accepted-and-ignored (now more lenient — `false` no longer 400s), and profiles stay `draft` exactly as today. The response is parsed as a lenient TS cast requiring only `user_id` (`http.ts:240`) and already reads `items[].lifecycle_status`, so the added `lifecycle_status` / `consent_recorded` fields don't break it. *(#353's always-create changes repeat-upload behavior, but that's #353, not this work.)*

## Out of scope

- **Action/connect consent** (issue item #4, share-PII on apply/connect) — belongs to the `action/perform` API. The GET status here is *profile/user* consent; choosing a profile for apply uses `profile_consent_accepted` + `live`, but the apply itself gates on action-consent separately.
- **Re-consent on version bump** — GET returns plain booleans, so a stale (older-version) acceptance is not surfaced; not handled now.
- **Guardian/U18 capture** — server-to-server can't do the OTP proof; minors go through the portal. Unchanged.
- **Read-consent-content API** (fetching consent copy text) — separate follow-up.

## Dependency & sequencing

PR #353 (always-create + per-user cap) is open on the same `feature` base and restructures the same handler/verdict surface (collides in `participant.ts` + the participant test files; no logical conflict in `item_service.ts`). **Land #353 first, then rebase `feat/participant-compliance-consent` onto it**, then implement these deltas. Post-#353 semantics are already assumed throughout this design (item_id required to target an existing profile).

## Already-done vs new work

- **Done on PR #354 (base design):** `compliance` schema + optional booleans; consent recording per branch (incl. update path); `lifecycle_status` + `consent_recorded`; promotion via the shared gate; conflict-safe `profile_creation` insert; minor-stays-draft e2e test.
- **New in this extension:** (0) request validation — accept-only any-false (`CONSENT_DECLINED`, schema) + `user_terms`/`user_privacy` both-or-none pair (`USER_LEVEL_INCOMPLETE`, schema) + gated-domain DOB-with-consent (`DOB_REQUIRED`, handler); (1) persist DOB on the update path (before promote); (2) promote-all-eligible-drafts on a DOB-bearing call; (3) dedupe user-level consent; (4) GET consent-status fields (`user_consent` + per-item `profile_consent_accepted`); (5) tests for the validation, activation, multi-profile, and read-status flows; (6) doc updates. Plus the #353 rebase.
