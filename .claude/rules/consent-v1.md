# Consent (v1)

Consent is an **append-only ledger** (`consent_record` table). Latest event per `(subject, type)` wins by `seq`, never by timestamp. Content is never stored in the row — only `(category, version)`; the text is resolved from `consent.json`. Levels:

- **user** — `terms` / `privacy` (keyed on `user_id`), via `/api/v1/consent`.
- **item** — `profile_creation` (keyed on `item_id`; idempotent via a partial unique index) and `action` rows (keyed on `item_id` + `action_id`, with `action_type` / `action_stage`).

Two invariants worth internalising:

- **Version is derived server-side.** Never trust a client-supplied version integer. `apps/api/src/services/consent_version.ts` (`resolveConsentVersion`) reads the cached config for the `(network, brand, category[, actionType, stage])` tuple and records that. A client cannot record acceptance of a version the user never saw.
- **Consent copy lives in `consent.json`, not `network.json`.** Each network's `consent.json` sits beside its `network.json` (brand overrides in a brand-named sub-folder), is loaded via `CONSENT_CONFIG_SOURCE` (`local` default; remote is a follow-up returning `[]`), and is cached as `consent_config` entries alongside network schemas (`network_schema_cache.ts`). This **replaced** the inline `consent_text_initiator` / `consent_text_receiver` fields that used to live in `network.json` action definitions — do not reintroduce them. See `packages/config/CLAUDE.md` for the loader's brand-override and `__SUPPORT_EMAIL__` substitution mechanics.
- **Support email is a placeholder, not a literal.** Consent copy ships a `__SUPPORT_EMAIL__` token (T&C/Privacy/Grievances); the consent loader renders it to `CONSENT_SUPPORT_EMAIL` (default `hello@bluedotseconomy.org`) at load, so the address is deploy-time configurable without editing consent content (#266). Distinct from `SUPPORT_EMAIL` (the contact-form recipient). Deployed instances may also have it substituted upstream at ConfigMap render.

`create_item` accepts an optional `consent` block to capture profile-creation consent atomically with the profile. `perform_action` / `update_action_status` gate on action-consent at `initiate` / `accept` stages.

The `/admin/participant` endpoint also records the ledger for external
channels: its `compliance` array maps to user-level `terms`/`privacy`
(`source='signup'`) and item-level `profile_creation` (`source='profile'`),
then promotes via `promoteItemOnProfileConsent`. The channel is captured in
each row's `metadata.channel`. It never records guardian consent (that
requires the OTP flow).

The participant endpoint validates consent payloads: any `compliance` value
`false` → `CONSENT_DECLINED`; `user_terms`/`user_privacy` are a both-or-none
pair (`USER_LEVEL_INCOMPLETE`); on guardian-gated domains the pair requires
`age` (integer years, stored as the `user.age` snapshot #331; `DOB_REQUIRED`,
handler-level via `guardianConsentRequired`).
Persisting `age` re-promotes all the user's eligible drafts
(`promoteEligibleDraftsForUser`). `GET /admin/participant` surfaces consent
status. It never records `source='guardian'` — U18 promotion still requires the
guardian OTP flow.

**Consent gates discoverability.** A profile is only network-visible (`lifecycle_status = live`) when its required fields are complete **and** `profile_creation` consent is accepted. Accepting profile consent (`routes/v1/consent/accept_profile_consent.ts`) calls `promoteItemOnProfileConsent` (`services/item_service.ts`), which re-runs the same `classify_item` completeness classifier used on write — with `consent_accepted: true` — and flips a `draft` item to `live`. Only `draft` is promoted: `paused` is sticky and `live` needs no change. Keep the completeness rules in the classifier, not duplicated in the consent path. The deploy migration for existing rows is a one-off backfill, `pnpm db:backfill:consent:api` (`apps/api` `db:backfill:consent`).

**U18 guardian gate is the one age control on every go-live path.** For domains where `guardianConsentRequired(networkConfig, domain)` is true, a minor's profile cannot reach `live` on the ward's own self-consent — only a guardian's `source='guardian'` `profile_creation` row promotes it. `guardianGateBlocksGoLive` (`services/item_service.ts`) is **THE single source of truth**; it is called on *both* promotion paths (the create/consent-accept promote at `item_service.ts:441` and the item-update path at `:614`) — do not re-derive the age check inline in either. It is **fail-closed** on two fronts: a null `age` on a gated domain is never treated as adult (age capture is client-side, stored as the `user.age` snapshot #331; `u18_precheck` is a hint, not a control), and a minor with no guardian row stays `draft`. A proven adult, or any user on a non-gated domain, is never blocked. The bypass this closed (#311) was a promotion path that read `hasAcceptedProfileConsent` source-agnostically — any new go-live path must route through `guardianGateBlocksGoLive`, not a raw consent-presence check.
