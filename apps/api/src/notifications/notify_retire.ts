/**
 * Fire-and-forget notifier for the retire → counterparty email (#418).
 *
 * Called from the lifecycle route AFTER the retire transaction commits, with
 * the counterparties whose open connections `cancelItemConnections` ended. For
 * each, resolves the (local) owner email and sends one branded email using the
 * dedicated retire-cancel copy. Reuses the action-notifier config, brand
 * resolution, owner-email lookup, and render shell.
 *
 * Never throws and never blocks the route (mirrors `dispatchActionNotifications`).
 * No-op when notifications aren't configured. A counterparty with no local user
 * (owner-less, or hosted on another instance) resolves to no email and is
 * skipped — this is the v1 "local counterparties only" rule.
 *
 * @param brandNetwork the retired item's network id, for the brand sign-off.
