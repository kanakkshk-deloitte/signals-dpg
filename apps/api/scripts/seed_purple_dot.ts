/**
 * Seed Purple Dot sample records — FAST-PATH FALLBACK.
 *
 * This script bypasses the Aggregator-DPG handshake and writes directly to
 * Signals' DB. Useful for fast iteration on Signals-internal features.
 *
 * For full end-to-end integration testing of the Aggregator → Signals flow,
 * use the operator runbook at:
 *   docs/operations/e2e-purple-dot-runbook.md
 * which drives the real public registration endpoint via
 *   pnpm e2e:qr <link-slug> [count]
 * and the real /action/perform API via
 *   pnpm e2e:actions
 *
 * Creates (when run via this fallback):
 *   - organization "purple_dot_aggregator" (type='aggregator')   [default mode only]
 *   - user "purple_dot_seed" (service account for the aggregator)
 *   - member row linking purple_dot_seed to the aggregator org (role='service')
 *   - one user per seeker / provider record (deterministic ids derived from
 *     mobile / contact_phone), each attributed to the aggregator org via
 *     onboardedByOrgId/onboardedVia='seed'/onboardedSourceId
 *   - items (seeker + provider) with items.created_by pointing at the
 *     per-record user (not the shared service account).
 *
 * Idempotent: short-circuits if any rows already exist for network=purple_dot.
 * Mirrors apps/api/src/routes/v1/item/create_item.ts for partition setup,
 * schema validation, and item_instance_url / item_schema_url construction.
 *
 * Invocation:
 *   # Default: creates / patches the seed aggregator org.
 *   pnpm --filter api db:seed:purple_dot
 *   pnpm db:seed:purple_dot:api   # from repo root
 *
 *   # Link records to an org you've already registered via the Aggregator UI:
 *   pnpm db:seed:purple_dot:api -- --org-id org_abc123
 *   pnpm db:seed:purple_dot:api -- org_abc123   # positional shorthand
 *
 *   When --org-id is supplied the script does NOT create the org. It verifies
 *   the row exists (errors out if not) and patches `metadata.domains` only
 *   when missing — so the aggregator dashboard works without overwriting
 *   slug / name / type set by the Aggregator registration flow.
 *
 * Env overrides:
 *   PURPLE_DOT_NETWORK_JSON   path to network.json (default: examples/schemas/purple_dot/network.json)
 *   PURPLE_DOT_INSTANCE_URL   item_instance_url to record (default: http://localhost:2742)
 *   PURPLE_DOT_SEED_DRY_RUN   if set, validates records against the schema and exits without touching DB
