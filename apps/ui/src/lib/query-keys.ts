 * flag-back): the page migration (Plan 2b-ii) and the #203 scale work consume
 * them, and browse/markers filters must eventually carry the §8 axes (rounded
 * viewport bucket, offset, active profile, location source, instance URL).

   * - `snappedBbox` + `zoomBand` (see `lib/map-viewport-snap.ts`) when the
   *   viewport has a bbox — a snapped-grid bbox + a clustered/individual zoom
   *   band, so a pan/zoom that stays within the same grid cell and band
   *   reuses the cache entry while a real move/zoom-band-cross busts it.
   * - `bboxToken` (bbox path only, #203 map-serverside-search Task 5) — a
   *   counter `useMapMarkers` bumps to force this key to change when the
   *   padded-bbox + truncated-result refetch rule decides a contained
   *   zoom-in must still refetch (the held result was truncated) even
   *   though the snapped bbox coincidentally rounds to the same grid cell as
   *   the last fetch — see `lib/map-viewport-snap.ts`'s `shouldRefetch`.
   * - `latBucket`/`lngBucket`/`radiusBucket` instead, for the older
   *   radius-only viewport shape (hand-built viewports predating the bbox
   *   work; still exercised by existing tests).
   * - `filters` — the active facet filter set (`item_state.*`), wired end to
   *   end starting Task 7; included here from Task 4 on so the key shape is
   *   ready and a filter change always produces a distinct key.
   * - `limit`.

   * exists; wire cache busting when added), activeProfileId (map never calls
   * discover; still deferred pending relevance-ranked map pins, P-follow-5 —
   * contrast `browseItems` above, where the anchor landed in #394).
