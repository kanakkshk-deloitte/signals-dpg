# CLAUDE.md — packages/auth

better-auth configuration + the unified OTP plugin. Root `CLAUDE.md`'s "Auth model" and "Self-signup + login channels" sections cover the *routes and headers* a caller sees; this doc covers how this package wires better-auth itself and the OTP flow underneath.

## How better-auth is wired (`src/config.ts`)

`createAuth()` builds one `betterAuth(...)` instance with:
- a Drizzle Postgres adapter (`drizzleAdapter(config.db, { provider: 'pg' })`),
- Redis as `secondaryStorage` (session + OTP storage — `get`/`set` proxy straight to the injected `redis` client),
- five plugins: `openAPI`, `bearer`, `admin`, `organization`, `unifiedOtp` (the custom plugin in `plugins/unified_otp.ts`), plus `apiKey` (from `@better-auth/api-key`).

## The instance-level rate limit is **off** — `apiKey` has its own instead

`config.ts:65-67` sets `rateLimit: { enabled: false }` on the top-level `betterAuth(...)` call — **OTP request/verify endpoints have no built-in rate limiting.** The only rate limit in this package is scoped to the separate `apiKey` plugin's config (`config.ts:12-15`: `timeWindow: 1h, maxRequests: 10000`), which governs API-key usage, not OTP attempts. This is a known gap, not an oversight to quietly "fix" by re-enabling the global limiter (which would also throttle API-key traffic in ways that config wasn't designed for) — if OTP rate limiting is ever added, it should be scoped narrowly to the OTP endpoints, not flipped on globally.

## OTP flow (`plugins/unified_otp.ts`)

- `generateOtp(isTest)` returns the fixed `'000000'` when `isTest` is true — this is the `CREATE_TEST_OTP` flag guarded by `assertCreateTestOtpSafe` (`packages/config/src/secrets.ts`'s startup guard) — never assume this path is reachable in production.
- Storage is Redis-keyed: `otp:phone:<phoneNumber>` / `otp:email:<email>`, 5-minute TTL (`expiresInSec = 5 * 60`, `unified_otp.ts:361`), written via `ctx.context.secondaryStorage.set(key, otp, expiresInSec)`.
- Verification deletes the key on success (one-time use) — a stored OTP is never reusable after a correct verify.

## `plugins/auth_guards.ts` — two small, load-bearing guard functions

- **`assertChannelAllowed(identifier, loginChannels)`** — rejects an OTP request/verify whose identifier channel (phone vs email) isn't in the instance's `LOGIN_CHANNELS` config, before any OTP is generated.
- **`assertSelfSignupAllowed({ allowSelfSignup, email, adminByDomain })`** — the authoritative self-signup gate (see `.claude/rules/auth-model.md` for `SELF_SIGNUP_MODE`). Called at **both** `requestOtp` and `verifyOtp` — the two points new-user creation could occur — as defense-in-depth. Has one bypass: `isAdminDomainEmail(email, adminByDomain)` lets an email on a configured admin domain through even when signup is gated (the admin bootstrap path). **If you ever touch one call site, check the other** — a fix applied to only `requestOtp` or only `verifyOtp` reopens the gate at the other entry point.
