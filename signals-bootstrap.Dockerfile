# One-shot bootstrap image for signals-dpg's database.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: signals-dpg's production API image (apps/api/Dockerfile) is
# pruned to prod-only dependencies, so it does NOT contain drizzle-kit or tsx
# and therefore cannot run migrations or the init/seed scripts. This image
# installs the FULL dependency set (dev included) so the compose can run, in one
# shot and on the correct linux/arm64|amd64 platform:
#
#   pnpm --filter api exec drizzle-kit push   (apply Drizzle schema)
#   pnpm --filter api db:init                 (extensions + items/actions/events tables)
#   pnpm --filter api db:seed:services        (OPTIONAL — only for integrating DPGs)
#
# Build context is the signals-dpg repo root (../ from this file, set as `..`
# in ../docker-compose.yml). It is a throwaway "tools" container: it runs to
# completion once, then exits 0. signals-api waits for it via
# `depends_on: condition: service_completed_successfully`.
#
# Installing here is independent of your host node_modules (which may be built
# for macOS), avoiding the classic bind-mount platform mismatch.
